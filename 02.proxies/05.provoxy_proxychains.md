#### 5.1. About

Proxy HTTP requests from binary/script as:
```
Proxychains ------> Privoxy ------> Burp
```

This is suitable for clients that are not proxy-aware, but require traffic manipulation in Burp (typically native/thick clients).


#### 5.2. Proxychains config
```
# proxy_dns
quiet_mode
http 127.0.0.1 8118
```
Proxychains will proxy to `localhost:8118`.


#### 5.3. Privoxy config
```
listen-address  127.0.0.1:8118
forward   /   172.16.195.1:8080
forward   .example.com . # do not send this to Burp
```
Note: 
- `localhost:8118` will proxy to Burp upstream proxy
- `172.16.195.1:8080` is Burp


#### 5.4. In action
```
# proxychains http icanhazip.com -b
```

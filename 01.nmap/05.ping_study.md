#### 5.1. Behind ping scanning
- About: used to determine systems which are up
- Pros: quick with low network footprint
- Cons: works only if ICMP echo requests are *not* blocked by the firewall
- How does it work:
  1. Send ICMP echo packet
  2. Response = online

```
# nmap --help | grep -i 'ping scan'
  -sn: Ping Scan - disable port scan
```
Note: `-sP` flag is still available but deprecated.


#### 5.2. Home made ping scan

Let's run our own ping-sweep tool and study its effects.
```
# wc -l hosts.txt
20 hosts.txt
# time bash icmp_scanner.sh host.txt > icmp_scanner_results.txt

real	0m2.565s
user	0m0.004s
sys	0m0.004s
# wc -l icmp_scanner_results.txt
20 icmp_scanner_results.txt
# head -n4 icmp_scanner_results.txt
10.10.10.88 - is up!
10.10.10.90 - is up!
10.10.10.89 - is up!
10.10.10.93 - is up!
```
Note: 20/20 hosts are alive - took approx. 2.5s to complete the scan
```
# tcpdump -i tun0 -n 2>/dev/null > icmp_scanner_traffic.txt
# du -hs icmp_scanner_traffic.txt
4.0K	icmp_scanner_traffic.txt
```
Network traffic generated approx. 4K bytes


#### 5.3. Nmap ping scan

A) AKA - No port scan.
```
# time nmap -iL active.txt -sn -n -oG - | grep Host > /tmp/scan1

real	0m0.471s
user	0m0.004s
sys	0m0.008s
# tcpdump -i tun0 -n 2>/dev/null > traffic1.txt
# du -hs traffic1.txt
8.0K	traffic1.txt
# grep -i icmp traffic1.txt | wc -l
41
# wc -l traffic1.txt
60 traffic1.txt
# grep '.80' traffic1.txt | wc -l
3
# grep '.443' traffic1.txt | wc -l
17
```
Note: a "no port scan" does actually do a port scan on some common open ports (HTTP/HTTPS)

B) No port scan and no ping scan. (false claim - either run one of the other)
```
# time nmap -iL active.txt -sn -n -Pn -oG - | grep Host > /tmp/scan2

real	0m0.009s
user	0m0.004s
sys	0m0.000s
# tcpdump -i tun0 -n 2>/dev/null > traffic2.txt
# du -hs traffic2.txt
4.0K	traffic2.txt
# grep -i icmp traffic2.txt | wc -l
0
# wc -l traffic2.txt
1 traffic2.txt
```

##### 5.4. ICMP scanner (`icmp_scanner.sh`)
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# $1 - file with IP addresses
# This script will use `ping` to probe every host on the list.

[[ ! -e $1 ]] && echo 'Supply hosts file as parameter.' && exit
for ip in `cat $1`
do
   ping -c 1 -W 1 -w 1 $ip >/dev/null && echo $ip | tee -a /tmp/icmp_results.txt &
done
``` 
Note: `echo 10.10.18.{1..254} | sed 's/ /\n/g' > hosts.txt` to generate hosts file.
